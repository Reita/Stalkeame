/* What is Stalkeame? */
Stalkeame scans the pictures Twitter users upload to TwitPic, analyzes
each picture's EXIF data and displays the location where each photo was
taken on a nifty little map, all for your stalking pleasure. No data is
saved during this scan which is why Stalkeame may take a few minutes to
load. Please be patient (and please don't use it to actually stalk
anyone!).

/* Drawbacks */
Since Stalkeame does not save any sort of data each time it scans for
Twitpic photos the service can take up to 5 minutes or so to give a 
response. Twitpic is slow and unreliable and their API is quite
terrible.

I had to resort to using a regular expression in order to scan users'
pictures so if Twitpic ever decides to update their layout that'd mean
Stalkeame will break.

/* To do */
Rewrite the backend and perhaps start saving/caching data.
